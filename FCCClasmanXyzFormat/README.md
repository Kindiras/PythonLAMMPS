# FCC_structure_clsman_xyz-format
This helps to creat the Fcc crystal structure (100) in clsman or xyz format.
getnew_config.py and runnew_conf.py should be in the same directory.
To run this code=>open terminal and go the the directory where these files are located.
python should be installed in the machine.
python getnew_config.py -t clsman (for clsman format)or python getnew_config.py -t xyz (for xyz format).
It will ask the input values and you have to give the inputs.
